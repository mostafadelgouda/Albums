The app is composed of 2 screens, first is the profile screen, it has the user name and address
pinned at the top and then it lists all of this userâ€™s albums. You can get user albums by requesting
the albums endpoint and passing user id as a parameter.
When you press on any album it navigates to the second screen which is an album details screen.
You request the photos endpoint and pass album id as a parameter, then list the images in an
instagram-like grid. Also there is a search bar that you can filter within the album by the
image title.
